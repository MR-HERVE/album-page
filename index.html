            <h1>Website bio</h1>
            <p id="web-description">Initially it was my idea to have this photo session with Rema and Shenseea.From the photos 
                above u can see that my pictures aren't viewed,this is because I was the one taking them.
                But moving on forward we worked together in the editing of the photos and also in apploading
                them to this particular web page.At first Shenseea was not into  the idea but after talking 
                she could not say no to an old friend.On the other hand Rema was pretty much into the idea,
                he put it as a chance to reunite.I know you might be thinking on how we met well you are in 
                luck.Well it was just a coincidence that we bumped into each other in college,rather i bumped
                into them,they were doing their vocals in the music room.Rema was mostly into afrobeats whereas
                Shensea was more into hype music as they call it "dancehall".
