            <p>initially it was my idea to have this photo session with Rema and Shenseea.From the photos 
                above u can see that my pictures aren't viewed,this is because I was the one taking them.
                But moving on forward we worked together in the editing of the photos and also in apploading
                them to this particular web page.At first Shenseea was not into  the idea but after talking 
                she could not say no to an old friend.
